Promptimizer sends your original prompt to an AI with specialized instructions for prompt engineering. The AI applies best practices derived from Anthropic's guides on effective prompting, returning an enhanced version of your prompt that is:

- More specific and detailed
- Better structured
- More likely to produce the desired results

For **User Prompts**, it improves:
- Clarity and specificity
- Parameter definition
- Multi-part request structure
- Output preferences

For **System Prompts**, it enhances:
- Role definitions
- Behavioral guidelines
- Output requirements
- Error handling procedures

## üîÑ Dragging and Resizing

- **Move**: Drag the blue header to reposition the window
- **Resize**: Use the handles on the right, bottom, or corner to resize
- **Reset**: Click the ‚Ü∫ button to reset position and size
